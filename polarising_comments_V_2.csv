It's amazing how people can believe anything they read online without question.,Dismissive
"If you trust that source, I've got a bridge to sell you.",Dismissive
The cheapest way to manipulate public opinion is through clickbait headlines.,Dismissive
That sounds more like a baseless theory than a fact.,Dismissive
Seems like this is just another piece of misinformation.,Dismissive
Youre just parroting the same old rhetoric.,Dismissive
Looks like this whole discussion is full of automated responses.,Dismissive
Is anyone here actually reading past the headline?,Dismissive
People will believe anything as long as it aligns with their preconceived notions.,Dismissive
This comment section is a perfect example of why critical thinking is essential.,Dismissive
Seems like people are just regurgitating what they've been fed by the media.,Dismissive
"If people don't start questioning the information they consume, we're in trouble.",Dismissive
This sounds like a classic case of echo chamber effect.,Dismissive
Reading the same tired arguments over and over gets old.,Dismissive
Funny how easily people get triggered by differing opinions.,Dismissive
Youre just a mouthpiece for the same talking points we've heard a million times.,Dismissive
This debate has become nothing more than a battle of bots.,Dismissive
People seem to forget that not everything online is true.,Dismissive
"If you think thats a valid argument, you might need to do some more research.",Dismissive
Its hard to tell if people are serious or just trolling at this point.,Dismissive
"Sure, because Elon Musk is totally the answer to everything, right?",Dismissive
"Oh, of course, that's exactly what they want you to think.",Dismissive
This is just another part of the grand plan to let the secret elite have their way.,Dismissive
"It's almost hilarious how transparent this is, but it'll definitely fool the usual crowd.",Dismissive
"Wow, breaking news! Someone just discovered what the rest of us knew ages ago.",Dismissive
Have you even glanced at Twitter lately? It's a mess.,Dismissive
"Elon Musk is the new messiah? Please, give me a break.",Dismissive
"Yeah, thats the story theyre feeding you, but Im not buying it.",Dismissive
"Another day, another conspiracy theory. Whats next, aliens running the government?",Dismissive
"Its amusing how obvious the manipulation is, but people will still eat it up.",Dismissive
"Oh, so now everyones suddenly an expert on this? How convenient.",Dismissive
Have you been on social media recently? Its like a playground for misinformation.,Dismissive
"Let me guess, Elon Musk is going to save the world next? How original.",Dismissive
"Thats what they want you to believe, but the reality is quite different.",Dismissive
This is just another narrative to keep people distracted from whats really happening.,Dismissive
Its almost comedic how easy it is to spin a story and watch people believe it.,Dismissive
"Sure, because people who live under rocks are the last to hear anything.",Dismissive
Seen Twitter lately? Its a dumpster fire of bad takes and misinformation.,Dismissive
Elon Musk as the hero? Ill believe it when I see it.,Dismissive
"Thats the line theyre selling, but it doesnt mean we have to buy it.",Dismissive
Reddit has become a haven for people arguing with bots and trolls. It's out of control.,Dismissive
Just scroll through their post history. It's obvious they're not even real users.,Dismissive
"Honestly, where do these people even find their information? It's baffling.",Dismissive
The absence of basic critical thinking skills here is sometimes unbelievable.,Dismissive
Imagine taking everything you see online at face value. It's astonishing.,Dismissive
"This site is a hotbed for misinformation, and it's painfully obvious.",Dismissive
Some users here seriously need to step outside and reconnect with reality.,Dismissive
It's almost comical how some users act like they're geniuses but can't support their claims.,Dismissive
"You're not here for the facts, just to push your own narrative.",Dismissive
"Arguing with you feels like trying to communicate with a brick wall, completely futile.",Dismissive
People are so fast to jump to conclusions without considering the evidence.,Dismissive
It's disheartening to see how many are just echoing what they've been told without any thought.,Dismissive
"Having an opinion is one thing, but there's a fine line between that and blatant ignorance.",Dismissive
I can't wrap my head around how many people actually fall for this stuff.,Dismissive
You're just regurgitating what you've heard without any critical analysis.,Dismissive
Why even bother engaging in a debate if you're not open to reconsidering your views?,Dismissive
The level of cognitive dissonance in some comments here is mind-blowing.,Dismissive
Do you even realize how ridiculous your arguments sound?,Dismissive
It's almost laughable how confidently wrong some people can be on here.,Dismissive
This platform is becoming a parody of itself with all the misinformation.,Dismissive
"If you don't believe in climate change, you're just ignoring the facts. It's not even worth the discussion.",Dismissive
"The founding fathers wanted to ensure their freedom, that's why the second amendment exists. If you don't like it, maybe this place isn't for you.",Dismissive
Anyone who stands against gun control clearly has no regard for human life.,Dismissive
Those who oppose universal healthcare have never struggled to pay for medical bills.,Dismissive
"If you're against taxing the wealthy more, it's pretty clear you're just looking out for yourself.",Dismissive
"Oh, sure, let's throw out years of research and rely on some random internet post instead.",Dismissive
"Yeah, because your wild conspiracy theories definitely trump actual scientific consensus.",Dismissive
You seriously need to do some research before making such uninformed comments.,Dismissive
Just accept it and move on; your opinion is not going to change the facts.,Dismissive
Anyone with a brain knows that stricter immigration laws are necessary; you'd have to be clueless to disagree.,Dismissive
No one with any common sense would back such a ridiculous idea.,Dismissive
The anti-vaxxer movement is a real threat. People who refuse to vaccinate are just spreading dangerous misinformation.,Dismissive
People who supported that candidate are clearly brainwashed. It's pointless to try to reason with them.,Dismissive
Opponents of this legislation are just standing in the way of progress.,Dismissive
"If you're still denying climate change, you're living in denial. The science is undeniable.",Dismissive
"The second amendment is a safeguard of freedom. If you can't understand that, you're missing the point.",Dismissive
Anyone who is against stronger gun regulations simply doesn't value human life.,Dismissive
Those who are against universal healthcare clearly don't understand the struggles of the less fortunate.,Dismissive
"If you think the rich shouldn't pay more taxes, you're just being selfish.",Dismissive
Ignoring expert advice in favor of random social media posts is just plain ignorant.,Dismissive
Wait until they realize where their organic kale is actually grown.,Dismissive
"You WILL give up your car to save the planet by a fraction of a degree, and you WILL be happy about it.",Dismissive
Why raise cattle when we can just buy beef from the store? - brilliant logic.,Dismissive
I genuinely can't comprehend the thought process of these people... I doubt I ever will.,Dismissive
His mind is clearly underdeveloped if he thinks all food just magically appears in stores.,Dismissive
"The moment someone starts up-talking, you know they have no idea what they're discussing.",Dismissive
Anyone who suggests that should go without modern agriculture for a week and see how they feel.,Dismissive
These mindless followers will latch onto any narrative they're fed.,Dismissive
The brainwashing is complete with these people!,Dismissive
Just another puppet in the system.,Dismissive
"This is exactly why taxpayer money should NOT fund higher education. If this is what students are learning, they and their parents should foot the bill entirely.",Dismissive
So it's the farmers' fault now? They barely break even after all their costs. Maybe he should try a hunger strike to show his commitment to the cause.,Dismissive
None of this even matters; it's all just a simulation.,Dismissive
"Sure, let's all stop eating and see how well that works out.",Dismissive
"Also, ""gee, why is everything out of stock?""",Dismissive
"Ever notice how that plastic trash in the ocean looks brand new? No algae, no sea life... it's almost like it's placed there on purpose.",Dismissive
"That's not climate change; it's pollution. We've been saying this all along focus on real issues, not imaginary carbon problems.",Dismissive
"I spotted a tiny bit of algae at the end, but this is still obviously fake there's no debris, no marine life, nothing else floating with it.",Dismissive
Climate anxiety is just as fake as climate change itself. But the propaganda? That's very real. And guess what? You're the 'carbon' they want to eliminate.,Dismissive
"I've met more than one person who turned down a raise because they thought they'd end up making less money because of taxes. Nahhhh, son. Nah.",Dismissive
I work in oil/gas in Canada. I'd say 80% of the guys here don't understand how progressive tax brackets work,Dismissive
The oil and gas industry has to be the career path with the highest inverse proportions of dollars to brain cells.,Dismissive
 The number of FIFO workers here in Western Australia that can barely tie the laces on their steel cap boots - while making six figures from an entry level job - is ridiculous.,Dismissive
Lol yah these guys make 200k but don't know how taxes work,Dismissive
I spent 10 years in that industry. Name any subject matter. They don’t know how it works,Dismissive
All that detox health science bullshit. Your body already has a detox system. It's called your liver.,Dismissive

Ok buddy,Dismissive
"I can’t tell if this is funny, weird, or stupid",Dismissive
"I feel like for these people, they have ""accepted that they will always be hated no matter what"". So with that mindset, they try to make as many people around them miserable.",Dismissive

"Fuck's sake, this is the sort of bellend that wouldn't take her seriously unless she was living entirely off the land and wearing only strategically placed leaves. Then they'd say she was a nutcase with no concept of reality. Can't win really.",Dismissive
I bet she exhales CO2 as well. A true scam artist!,Dismissive
The problem here is that it took him 5 minutes to write his chain of lies. Disproving them one by one takes much more effort and time.,Dismissive
"Bullshit goes around the world 3 times before it is corrected, and i fear it is a tactic used more and more by bad faith actors. To overwhelm the person you ""debate"" with as many lies as you can.",Dismissive
"It's called gish gallop. Basically you just throw out so much nonsense, it becomes impossible to refute it all.",Dismissive
 Climate deniers happily throw 5-10 of those at a time and then conclude they won when you do not refute every single one of them.,Dismissive
Name an instance where you don't have your head in your ass.... I'll wait.,Dismissive
"As someone who has tuberculosis, this is bullshit.",Dismissive
"Surprisingly, though, the answer is also a mix of fact and bullshit.",Dismissive

"I’ve always preferred left-leaning “social” politics, but fucking idiots like this make us all look bad.",Dismissive
Western wannabe communists are so dense it’s unreal.,Dismissive
"I can't decide if this is sad, funny, or just plain bizarre.",Dismissive
"It's like they've resigned themselves to being disliked, so they go out of their way to make everyone else miserable too.",Dismissive
Glares at people as if its going to magically make them taller or more likable.,Dismissive
here we go again with the self-pity parade.,Dismissive
"Honestly, failing is fine, but labeling yourself as an incel is just shooting yourself in the foot.",Dismissive
"The whole blackpill ideology is ridiculous, and it's clear to anyone who interacts with the real world.",Dismissive
"Just ignore the incel rhetoric, it's not even worth acknowledging.",Dismissive
"Gee, I wonder why he has such a hard time with women...",Dismissive
"""You'll never be more than a number."" ""I can't get any women."" Who's going to break it to him?",Dismissive
"Go figure, the outcome was exactly what anyone with common sense would expect.",Dismissive
"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. It's a universal truth.",Dismissive
This is the kind of guy who wouldn't take a woman seriously unless she was living off the grid. Then he'd call her delusional.,Dismissive
She probably breathes oxygen too. What a con artist!,Dismissive
"The problem is that it takes him five minutes to spew lies, but much longer to debunk each one.",Dismissive
"Lies spread faster than truth, and unfortunately, it seems to be a deliberate tactic these days.",Dismissive
It's called gish gallopâ€”flooding the conversation with nonsense so no one can keep up.,Dismissive
"Climate deniers love to bombard you with falsehoods, then claim victory when you don't counter every single one.",Dismissive
Name one time when you weren't talking out of your ass... I'll wait.,Dismissive
"As someone who's been through it, I can tell you this is complete BS.",Dismissive
It's funny how they mix a little bit of truth with a whole lot of nonsense.,Dismissive
You can see how much effort they put into overthinking their own fake argument.,Dismissive
"For a moment, I thought two people were actually dumb enough to post this.",Dismissive
"I've always leaned left socially, but idiots like this make us all look bad.",Dismissive
"Western wannabe communists are so out of touch, it's almost comical.",Dismissive

that many people actually liked this nonsense? Unreal.,Dismissive
How can you seriously preach that as a triumph? Pick up a history book.,Dismissive
"That girl posts some wild stuff, including conspiracy theories that are completely off the wall.",Dismissive
This is what happens when people speak on topics they know nothing about.,Dismissive
They should really take a look at 'Ukraine 1932-1933'. The mass starvation is undeniable.,Dismissive
"As a leftist, it's mind-boggling how anyone can still defend Stalin, the biggest stain on socialism.",Dismissive
Because mass slaughter in the name of economic necessity is somehow justified?,Dismissive
"Please, let's not confuse the issue with actual facts.",Dismissive
"What an idiot, doesn't she know about the gulags? Seriously?",Dismissive
Is she really that clueless?,Dismissive
How dense do you have to be to defend communism and ignore the atrocities of the USSR?,Dismissive
