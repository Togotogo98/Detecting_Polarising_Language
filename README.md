# Detecting Polarising Language
# Project Overview

The Detecting Polarising Language project aims to identify whether a given social media comment is polarising or non-polarising. The goal is to analyze the language used in online platforms to detect content that could incite division or provoke strong reactions. By classifying comments, this project helps promote healthier online discussions.

# Features

Data Collection: Utilizes the Reddit API to fetch a diverse range of social media comments.

Manual Annotation: Each comment is manually labeled as either polarising or non-polarising.

Machine Learning: Employs a transformer-based model (DistilBERT) to classify comments effectively.

Performance Metrics: Evaluates the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries and Frameworks:

Transformers (for using DistilBERT)

Pandas (data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (evaluation metrics)

Reddit API (data collection)
